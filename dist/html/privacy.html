<p>At www.Voicehacks.com (“Voicehacks” “we,” or “us”), we know You are concerned about Your privacy, so we developed this Privacy Policy to explain how we collect, use, and disclose Your Personal Information (defined below). As a guiding principal, our mission at Voicehacks is to assist You with Your efforts to share or identify innovation by making it easier for You to exchange innovative ideas, technologies, products or companies. For example, that means we take the information You provide us and make it available to certain businesses – all in order to facilitate the dissemination of information regarding your business. Read on and we will tell You how this all works.</p>

<p>By registering with Voicehacks Community and/or using this site or any of our event related websites (the “Sites”), You are accepting the policies and practices described in this Privacy Policy. Each time You visit the Site or provide us with information You agree that You are consenting to our use and disclosure of the information that You provide, and consenting to receive emails or otherwise be contacted, as described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into the Voicehacks Community Terms of Use. If a term is capitalized and not defined in this Privacy Policy, it is defined in the Voicehacks Community Terms of Use.</p>

<p>YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED BY US IN THE COUNTRY WHERE IT WAS COLLECTED AS WELL AS OTHER COUNTRIES (INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES) WHERE LAWS REGARDING PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN THE LAWS IN YOUR COUNTRY.
So we are clear about the terminology we are using, when we use the phrase “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we mean information about You that is personally identifiable to You, like Your name, address, e-mail address, or phone number, as well as other non-public information that is associated with the foregoing, Your Account Information and Voicehacks Community Profile. When we use the phrase “Non-Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we mean information that is not associated with or linked to Your Personal Information. Non-Personal Information does not enable identification of or contact with individual persons.</p>

<h4>CHILDREN</h4>
<p>The Site is not directed to children and children are not eligible to use our Services. Protecting the privacy of children is very important to us. We do not collect or maintain Personal Information from people we actually know are under 18 years of age, and no part of our Site or Service is designed to attract people under 18 years of age. If we later learn that a user is under 18 years of age, we will take steps to remove that user’s Personal Information from our databases and to prevent the user from utilizing the Site and the Service.</p>

<h4>HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION</h4>
<p>In general, the Personal Information we gather from You helps us learn more about the use of the Site or Services and provide you with access to the Site and/or Services in accordance with the Terms of Use. We collect the following Personal Information that You submit to us voluntarily. Our login process requires You to provide us with information such as Your valid email address and password. When You register with us or otherwise establish an Account with us, we may ask for certain information, including but not limited to Your name, valid email address, and password of Your choosing, information about Your business or other related information, and in some cases credit card or other payment information when You order Services or register for events online (Your “Voicehacks Community Profile”). We may also request optional information to support Your access to the Site or Services. For example, when You sign up to receive information about Voicehacks Community or any of our events, we may collect Your email address and other information related to your request. When You communicate with us by sending us an email, or otherwise complete online forms, surveys or contest entries, we will collect any information that is contained in Your communications with us. We may store this information on behalf of our users as necessary to fulfill our obligations to our users. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but this may limit the features of the Site or Services You are able to use. We do all of this to help us in our effort to help You with Your involvement with Voicehacks Community and to offer You other services as applicable.</p>

<h4>INFORMATION COLLECTED VIA TECHNOLOGY</h4>
<p>As You use the Site or Services, certain information may also be passively collected and stored on our or our service providers’ server logs, including Your Internet protocol address, browser type, and operating system. We also use Cookies and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of Your visit and the solutions and information for which You searched and viewed, or on which of the advertisements displayed on the Site You clicked. This type of information is collected to make the Site or Services and solutions more useful to You and to tailor the experience with the Site or Services to meet Your special interests and needs.</p>
<p>An “Internet protocol address” or “IP Address” is a number that is automatically assigned to Your computer when You use the Internet. In some cases Your IP Address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if You use a consumer internet access provider, Your IP Address probably varies from session to session. We, or our service providers, may track Your IP Address when You access the Site or Services.</p>
<p>“Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website sends to Your computer’s hard drive while You are viewing a website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once You close Your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on Your computer until You delete them) to provide You with a more personal and interactive experience with the Site or Services. Persistent Cookies can be removed by following Your Internet browser help file directions. If You choose to disable Cookies, some areas of the Site or Services may not work properly.
We may contract with several online partners to help manage and optimize our Internet business and communications. For example, we may use the services of a marketing Voicehacks Community to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our Site. To do this, we may use web beacons, clear GIFs and cookies provided by our marketing Voicehacks Community on this Site. The information collected helps us learn things like what kinds of customers our Site attracts, which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see.</p>
<p>We may also enable advertisers and ad servers to promote third-party products and/or services by placing advertisements on the Site. These advertisers and ad servers may use Cookies and/or “Web Beacons” (which are usually small, transparent graphic images) in order to monitor information related to served advertisements. Clicking on such advertisements will direct You to the website of a third-party and the advertiser. This Privacy Policy does not cover the privacy practices of any advertisers or ad servers.</p>

<h4>INFORMATION FROM OTHER SOURCES</h4>
<p>We may receive Personal Information about You from other sources like telephone, fax or email, from third-parties that provide services for us in connection with the Site or Services, as well as from other users and third parties to whom You have voluntarily provided information. We may add this information to the information we have already collected from You via the Site or Services. This Privacy Policy does not restrict our use of that additional information.</p>
